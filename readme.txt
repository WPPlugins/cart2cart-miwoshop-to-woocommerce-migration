Yes, Cart2Cart supports migration of reviews while moving to and from WooCommerce. Moreover, review ratings will be moved together with reviews.


= Do you migrate the customer passwords? =
"I would like to migrate from one shopping cart to another with encrypted customer passwords. Is there a way for customers to preserve the accounts but be prompted to enter new passwords? "
Customer accounts can be migrated from source to target shopping cart. Cart2Cart doesn't migrate the passwords, because they are encrypted specifically.
Your clients should use Password Recovery tool on your target shopping cart to access their accounts. However, order history* will be available after the migration.
*Note: Please, check if migration of corresponding types of data is supported for your shopping cart.

= Why Cart2Cart may need an access to FTP account details? =

In order to detect and investigate the problem, Cart2Cart Support Team may require access to the files of your online store installation. Follow the steps outlined in the Access to your online store section of this article.
Make sure that this account is a user-level account that has access to the directory in which your online shop is installed, unless our technician specifically requests an unrestricted access account (see below).
